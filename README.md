### Extra Challenges

1. Optimize screen rendering
   (remove screen.Clear and explicity clear only the pixels you need to delete)
2. Change the colors of objects in-game
3. Randomize ball speed and/or bounce angle
   (make it less predictible)
4. Don't game over on scored points
   Instead, keep track of scores,
   reset the game after someone scores and "game over"
   once someone reaches score of 5 (or whatever score you wish).
   For this challenge, you'll have to run your game inside an
   explicit frame on the screen instead of always running it "full screen".
   This will enable you to get some free space to render the scores in the game.
5. Add in-game bonuses
6. Dynamically change ball direction based on where the ball hits the paddle
